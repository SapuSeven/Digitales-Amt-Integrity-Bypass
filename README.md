# Digitales-Amt-Integrity-Bypass
An XPosed/LSPosed module that allows the use of "Digitales Amt" on a rooted device.

Tested and compatible with Digitales Amt v2.4.1 (newer versions may work as well).

## Installation
Assuming you already have an Android device rooted using Magisk:

- Install the [Zygisk LSPosed](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed/releases) Magisk module and reboot
- Install this [Integrity Check Bypass](https://github.com/SapuSeven/Digitales-Amt-Integrity-Bypass/releases) module
- Ensure "Digitales Amt" is **not** selected on the Magisk DenyList
- Enable the module in LSPosed and reboot
- Enjoy!
